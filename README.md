HyprYou (hyprland-material-you v2). It aims to provide a modern, feature-rich, and visually appealing desktop configuration. Here are some key features:

- **Material You Colors**: The project generates colors for your apps based on you wallpapers or settings.
- **Fluid Animations**: Expect natural and fluid animations throughout the desktop experience.
- **Design**: The design wherever possible is made by [Material 3 design](https://m3.material.io/)
- **Settings**: Almost all settings are possible to configure in settings! You don't need to change hyprland.conf unless you need something specific.
- **Clean home folder**: I made everything so won't have any unnecessary files in home. And from settings you can enable configs for terminals or anything else.

> [!TIP]
> When you run HyprYou as DE session (from SDDM, Greetd, etc.) it doesn't use `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`  
> For any custom variables/configs look for `~/.config/hypryou/hyprland.conf`  
> I made that so you can have different dotfiles on one system  
> If you don't have Display Manager you can use `hyprland --config /usr/share/hypryou/configs/hyprland/main.conf`

> [!NOTE]
> I'm doing everything by myself and **for free**.  
> If you want to support me, you can buy me a coffee on [**ko-fi**](https://ko-fi.com/koeqaife).

## Packages info

- `hypryou` - The main package, should be installed before anything else
- `hypryou-utils` - Replacement of `hypryou-qtutils`, uses gtk4 for hyprland dialogs instead of qt
- `hypryou-greeter` - Configs for greetd, so it's replacement of SDDM or anything like that. With Material 3 theme.

## How to install (Arch)

> [!TIP]
> If you have an error like "cannot resolve dependency" you should install packages that are named there with `yay` or any other AUR helpers.  
> For very new people to ArchLinux, check this: <https://itsfoss.com/install-yay-arch-linux/>  
> Also if AUR is down (it happens sometimes) you can check for Chaotic AUR: <https://aur.chaotic.cx/>  
> And if you have errors like `Config error in file /....` just try using `hyprctl reload`
